A black hole is an area in space where gravity is so strong that it pulls everything in and nothing can escape it, not even light. These are often made from a dying star.

This project primarily interacts with the concept of time but has areas of interacting with space as well. It creates an interaction with time by creating a sense of urgency when using the website and reading the fake AI generated articles as they fly into the black hole at the center of the page, only allowing for a short period of time to read the article.
On top of limiting reading time it also limits time on the site itself as it will close 30 seconds after being opened.

It interacts with the concept of space by providing a drag and drop zone for people to hypothetically clear items off of their computer by sending it into the black hole never to be seen again.
(It does not delete the files off of your computer, I would do that but it seems like a bad idea)

I landed on the idea of sending news articles and bits of information into the black hole due to the fact that the news is very grim lately and it feels as though it is only getting harder and harder to look at so I find myself often skimming through just the headlines before I eventually just stop trying to look at it in the first place unless something really grabs my eye. It feels like it was a waste of time to look at the news as a result so I decided to see how I would look at news if I was limited to how much I could read before it disappeared. I find myself picking out any random news article on this page and trying to read as much as I can as fast as possible before it vanishes.

This is also a form of commentary on how fast the news will move on from any type of story that comes up, no matter how serious or unserious the matter being written about may be.
This is a very conceptual piece so I hope people find their own interpretations of what it means for themselves.

I used gsap libraries to achieve the animations used in the website, the libraries documentation was all right however I found myself often looking to youtube tutorials to help myself understand how to use the library as well as slides from class, I also used AI to help explain and build the implementations of the library so that I could get it to look how I wanted in the end.
